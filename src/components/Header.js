                <Text>Scratch the furniture i like big cats and i can not lie. Making sure that fluff gets into the owner's eyes ask for petting then cats take over the world and need to chase tail, jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed. Flex claws on the human's belly and purr like a lawnmower meow to be let out, drink water out of the faucet. I'm going to lap some water out of my master's cup meow lick yarn hanging out of own butt so cough yet i'm going to lap some water out of my master's cup meow all of a sudden cat goes crazy. Destroy the blinds meow loudly just to annoy owners. Eat from dog's food scream for no reason at 4 am. Twitch tail in permanent irritation.</Text>
